![That's me](/images/avatar.jpg#float-right)

I am a Software Engineer, currently living in MÃ¼nster, Germany. Software Engineering is my passion and I'm doing it for quite a few years now. I primarily work on web applications, but I may also dip my nose in desktop or embedded systems applications. I'm very passionate about clean coding practices and staying low on technical debt.

When I'm not coding you can find me outside hiking, in my garden, or in the bouldering gym.
